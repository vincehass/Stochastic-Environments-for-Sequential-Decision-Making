Here is a very detailed pseudo-algorithm that describes the KL divergence optimization with entropy-ratio estimation for Stochastic GFlowNets. This step-by-step breakdown should help you code the method effectively.

### Pseudo-Algorithm: KL Divergence Optimization with Entropy-Ratio Estimation for Stochastic GFlowNets

---

#### **Inputs:**

- \( P_F \) (Forward Policy): The policy used to sample actions from the current state.
- \( P_B \) (Backward Policy): The policy used for backward transitions from future states to the current state.
- \( F \) (State Flow Function): Represents the unnormalized flow through each state.
- \( H\_{\text{high}}(s) \): Entropy of high-entropy states.
- \( H\_{\text{low}}(s) \): Entropy of low-entropy states.
- \( \gamma \): Hyperparameter controlling the balance between exploration (high-entropy states) and exploitation (low-entropy states).
- \( \alpha \): Learning rate for gradient-based optimization.
- \( N \): Number of iterations (training steps).

---

#### **Initialize:**

1. Initialize forward policy \( P_F \) and backward policy \( P_B \).
2. Initialize the state flow function \( F(s) \) for all states \( s \) in the environment.
3. Set hyperparameter \( \gamma \) for entropy-ratio estimation.
4. Set learning rate \( \alpha \) for optimization.

---

#### **Main Loop: (Repeat for \( N \) iterations)**

1. **Sample Trajectories Using Forward Policy**:

   - From the current state \( s_0 \), sample a trajectory \( \tau = \{s_0, s_1, \dots, s_T\} \) using the forward policy \( P_F \).
   - For each step \( t \) in the trajectory, sample the next state \( s*{t+1} \) using the probability distribution \( P_F(s*{t+1} | s_t) \).

2. **Compute State Flows**:

   - For each state \( s_t \) along the sampled trajectory \( \tau \), compute the forward state flow \( F(s_t) \).
   - For terminal states \( s_T \), the flow is set to the reward: \( F(s_T) = R(s_T) \).

3. **Update State Flow Function**:

   - For each transition \( (s*t \rightarrow s*{t+1}) \), calculate the updated forward flow as:
     \[
     F(s*t) \leftarrow \sum*{s*{t+1}} F(s*{t+1}) P*B(s_t | s*{t+1}).
     \]

4. **Compute KL Divergence Loss**:

   - For each transition \( (s*t \rightarrow s*{t+1}) \) in the trajectory:
     \[
     L*{KL}(s_t, s*{t+1}) = \log \left( P*F(s*{t+1} | s*t) \right) - \log \left( \frac{F(s*{t+1}) P*B(s_t | s*{t+1})}{F(s_t)} \right).
     \]
   - Sum over all transitions in the trajectory to get the total KL divergence loss \( L\_{KL} \).

5. **Estimate Entropy Ratio**:

   - For each state \( s*t \), compute the entropy of high-entropy states \( H*{\text{high}}(s*t) \) and low-entropy states \( H*{\text{low}}(s_t) \).
   - Compute the entropy ratio as:
     \[
     R*{\text{entropy}}(s_t) = \frac{H*{\text{high}}(s*t)}{\gamma H*{\text{high}}(s*t) + (1 - \gamma) H*{\text{low}}(s_t)}.
     \]

6. **Adjust Exploration-Exploitation Balance**:

   - Adjust the exploration-exploitation trade-off by updating the forward policy \( P*F \) using the entropy ratio \( R*{\text{entropy}}(s_t) \).
   - Specifically, modify the forward policy by multiplying the sampling probability by the entropy ratio:
     \[
     P*F'(s*{t+1} | s*t) \leftarrow P_F(s*{t+1} | s*t) \cdot R*{\text{entropy}}(s_t).
     \]
   - Normalize the forward policy after adjustment to ensure it remains a valid probability distribution.

7. **Gradient-Based Update for Forward and Backward Policies**:

   - Compute the gradient of the total loss \( L*{\text{total}} = L*{KL} + L*{\text{entropy}} \), where \( L*{\text{entropy}} \) is the loss term derived from the entropy-ratio estimation.
   - Update the parameters of the forward policy \( P*F \) and the backward policy \( P_B \) using gradient descent:
     \[
     P_F \leftarrow P_F - \alpha \cdot \nabla*{P*F} L*{\text{total}},
     \]
     \[
     P*B \leftarrow P_B - \alpha \cdot \nabla*{P*B} L*{\text{total}}.
     \]

8. **Repeat for All Trajectories in the Current Batch**:
   - For each trajectory sampled in this iteration, repeat steps 1-7, updating the policies and state flow function for every transition in the trajectory.

---

#### **End Loop**:

- After \( N \) iterations, the forward policy \( P_F \), backward policy \( P_B \), and state flow function \( F(s) \) are optimized for stochastic environments, balancing between exploration and exploitation using entropy-ratio estimation.

---

#### **Output:**

- Final optimized forward policy \( P_F \), backward policy \( P_B \), and state flow function \( F(s) \) for all states.

### Explanation:

1. **Trajectory Sampling**: The algorithm begins by sampling trajectories based on the current forward policy \( P_F \), which models the transitions between states. This policy is continuously adjusted throughout the algorithm.

2. **State Flow Calculation**: Each state in the trajectory is assigned a flow value, representing the unnormalized probability of passing through that state. For terminal states, the flow is set to the reward \( R(x) \).

3. **KL Divergence Loss**: The loss function measures the discrepancy between the forward and backward policies, ensuring they are consistent with the flow function.

4. **Entropy-Ratio Adjustment**: The entropy ratio is computed dynamically for each state, allowing the algorithm to prioritize exploration (favoring high-entropy states) or exploitation (favoring low-entropy states), depending on the balance controlled by \( \gamma \).

5. **Policy Update**: The policies are updated using gradient descent to minimize the KL divergence loss and the entropy-ratio estimation. The forward policy is further adjusted based on the entropy ratio, ensuring a balance between discovering new modes and exploiting known high-reward states.

This pseudo-algorithm provides detailed steps for implementing the proposed method, allowing you to code it in any programming language that supports gradient-based optimization.
