# Motif scoring for insurance pricing

Motif scoring for insurance pricing by incorporating customer demographics, competitor pricing, and a scoring system for evaluating pricing strategies.

### Python Code: Adapted for Insurance Pricing

### Breakdown of the Code Changes

1. **Customer Features Generation**:

   - **Age**, **income**, **claim history**, and **competitor pricing** are generated as features.
   - The customer demographics are randomized within specified ranges, capturing different segments of customers.

2. **Pricing Score Calculation**:

   - A customer segment is determined based on age and income.
   - **Price Sensitivity**: The model considers the price sensitivity for different segments (e.g., young with low income tends to be more sensitive to price).
   - **Competitor Pricing Adjustment**: The competitor price influences the final price calculated for the customer.
   - **Profit Margin Calculation**: The score is calculated to reflect the profit margin based on the final price and customer income.
   - This score is normalized to fall between 0 and 1.

3. **Dataset Generation**:
   - A dataset is generated with customer features, scores, and detailed reasoning for each score.
   - The dataset is saved as a JSON file for further use in training and testing insurance pricing models.

### Explanation on Adapting to the TFBIND Environment

- **State Representation**: The customer features (age, income, claim history, competitor pricing) represent the state similar to the nucleotide sequences in TFBIND.
- **Scoring System**: The score calculated here plays the role of binding affinity in the original TFBIND task, but adapted to represent the profit margin influenced by market competition and customer characteristics.
- **Dataset Similarity**: The dataset generated follows the same logic as TFBIND, where customer data and their associated scores can be used in a reinforcement learning setting to train an agent.

This approach effectively adapts the TFBIND sequence generation and scoring logic to insurance pricing, ensuring that customer demographics, competitor pricing, and profit margins are captured in the data generation process. Let me know if you need more details or further assistance!

## Time Series Prediction for Insurance Pricing

We adapt the given insurance pricing script to generate time series data, we will need to:

1. Modify the feature generation to create data points over time.
2. Represent each customerâ€™s interaction or changes over a sequence of time steps.
3. Maintain continuity and correlation across time steps, especially for features like income, competitor price, or claim history.

Here, I will implement the logic to generate time series data for multiple customers, where each data point includes information across several time steps.

### Explanation of Adaptation to Time Series

1. **Time Series Generation**:

   - For each customer, we generate initial features (`age`, `income`, `claim_history`, `competitor_price`).
   - We simulate data across multiple time steps (e.g., 12 months) for each customer.

2. **Updating Features Over Time**:

   - **Age**: Increases gradually over each month (`1/12` years per month).
   - **Income**: Adjusted by a random growth factor to simulate realistic monthly changes.
   - **Claim History**: Has a 5% chance of increasing each month.
   - **Competitor Pricing**: Random fluctuations are added at each time step to simulate competitive market changes.

3. **Score Calculation**:

   - The logic for calculating the price score is similar to the previous script, where features influence the pricing strategy.
   - A score and detailed reasoning are provided for each time step to understand how features like income, age, and competitor price impact the insurance pricing.

4. **Data Structure**:
   - Each customer has a time series dataset with information across multiple time steps.
   - Each time step entry includes the customer features at that time, the calculated score, and a reasoning breakdown.

This code allows you to simulate insurance pricing over time, giving insights into how customer characteristics and market conditions evolve and affect pricing decisions. Let me know if you need more details or modifications!

## Time Series Dataframe for Insurance Pricing

```

### Explanation of Changes

1. **DataFrame Generation**:

   - A new method named `generate_time_series_dataframe()` is added to generate a pandas DataFrame.
   - Each row represents a data point for a specific customer at a particular time step.

2. **Data Structure**:

   - Each record contains the following fields:
     - `customer_id`: The ID of the customer.
     - `time_step`: The time step in the series.
     - `age`, `income`, `claim_history`, `competitor_price`: The features of the customer.
     - `score`: The calculated pricing score.
     - `reasoning`: A detailed explanation of how the score was computed.

3. **Saving DataFrame**:

   - The method `save_dataframe_as_csv()` is provided to save the DataFrame to a `.csv` file.
   - The data is saved in a standard CSV format, making it suitable for further analysis.

4. **Previewing the DataFrame**:
   - The script prints the first 10 entries of the generated DataFrame for inspection.

### Example Preview of the DataFrame

The output will look something like:
